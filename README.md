# Biometric Attendance System - Django CRUD APIs

Welcome to the "Biometric Attendance System" Django project! This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and run the project's CRUD APIs. This project aims to provide a complete system for managing employee attendance using biometric data.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository from GitHub using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/biometric-attendance-system.git
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

Change to the project directory and create a virtual environment:

```bash
cd biometric-attendance-system
python -m venv venv
```

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

On macOS and Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Run Database Migrations

Run the initial database migrations to set up the database:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 6. Create Superuser (Optional)

If you want to access the Django admin interface, you can create a superuser account:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 7. Run the Development Server

Start the development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Now, you can access the API endpoints locally at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Using the CRUD APIs

This project provides several CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) APIs for managing employee data, attendance records, deductions, and more. Here are the API endpoints you can interact with:


-Employees API:'api/employee/'
              'api/employee/<int:id>/'
-Attendance Records API: 'api/ attendance/'
              'api/attendance/<int:id>/'
-Deduction Confirmation API: 'api/deduction-confirmation/'
              'api/deduction-confirmation/<int:id>/'
- Salary Deduction API:'api/salary-deduction/'
              'api/salary-deduction/<int:id>/'
-Admin User API: 'api/admin-user/'
                 'api/admin-user/<int:id>/'
-Deduction Reason API: 'api/deduction-reason/'
                'api/deduction-reason/<int:id>/'
- Overtime API: 'api/overtime/'
               'api/overtime/<int:id>/'
- Overtime Confirmation API: 'api/overtime-confirmation/'
               'api/overtime-confirmation/<int:id>/'
- Departments API: 'api/departments/'
               'api/departments/<int:id>/'

For each API, you can use HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to interact with the corresponding resources.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully set up the "Biometric Attendance System" Django project and its CRUD APIs. Feel free to explore the API documentation and integrate these APIs into your own applications.

If you have any questions or encounter issues, please refer to the project's documentation or seek help from the project community on GitHub. Happy coding!
